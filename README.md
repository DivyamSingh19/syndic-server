 
# 🌍 Syndic — Redefining Cross-Border Payments

### 💡 Overview

**Syndic** is a blockchain-powered cross-border payments platform designed to make **micro and regular remittances** instant, transparent, and affordable — especially for migrant workers and freelancers sending money between countries like **India and the UAE**.

Traditional remittance networks like **SWIFT** or intermediaries like **Remitly** charge high fees and take days to settle. Syndic solves this by introducing a **network of regionally connected “sister wallets”** that mirror and sync balances across countries — enabling **real-time off-ramping and on-ramping** between fiat and crypto rails.

### ⚙️ How It Works

1. **Local Settlement:**
   Instead of sending money physically across borders, Syndic settles transactions **locally** within each country’s sister wallet.

2. **Cross-Wallet Syncing:**
   Balances between sister wallets are synced on-chain — ensuring both parties see instant value transfer without delay.

3. **On/Off-Ramping:**
   Users can easily convert between fiat and crypto through licensed partners, enabling fast deposits and withdrawals.
